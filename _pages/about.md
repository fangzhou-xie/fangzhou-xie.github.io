Hi, my name is Fangzhou Xie.
I am currently a Ph.D. Candidate at the Department of Economics at Rutgers University.
Previously, I got my M.A. at the Department of Economics at New York University.<br /><br />

I am a fan of R/Rcpp/RcppEigen/RcppArmadillo/RcppThread, and I am also a developer of several R packages. 
You can check out my [repositories](/repositories).
